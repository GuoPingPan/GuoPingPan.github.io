I'm a master student at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School (SIGS), advised by Prof. Houde Liu. And I fortunately had ever been a research intern advised by Prof. Huazhe Xu at Shanghai Qizhi Institute.

 What's more, I am an invited lecturer at Intel Greater Bay Area Innovation Center. With a passion for open source, I had been a contributor of [OpenMMLab](https://github.com/open-mmlab) through the OSPP program.

Research Interests

I am now woking on improving the mobile manipulation capability of Legged Robot. I am also optimistic and interested in achieving general artificial intelligence to liberate the workforce. Embodied intelligence is my next "<span style="color: orange;">North Star</span>‚≠ê".
